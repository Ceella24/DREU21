title: Week 6
---

The sixth week began with the usual subgroup meeting and my daily meeting with my grad mentor at 5 pm. For some reason, my code from last week was giving me errors when I run it so I tried resolving that and that took me the entire week. I was also starting to feel under the weather so this week was very slow; it's part of working and research I guess, and I had to learn to deal with being less productive.
