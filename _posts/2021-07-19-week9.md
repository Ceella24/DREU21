I missed the 10 am meeting for this week and that is not recorded unfortunately. But I still got into my work for the week with high spirits. I created an XML file for the system testing the functionality of the Dynamic Regions Probabilistic Roadmap planning strategy. I run into a number of issues and the test still has not passed but it seems I am missing a file that hopefully someone in the lab would write so I can continue the project. I also spent a lot of time this week coming up with ideas and finally got my first draft of the presentation slides ready for the practice this Friday. 
The practice went really well and everyone came up with really great presentations and we also got great feedback so I’m looking forward to making those changes and see how great the presentation would be. I would try to include the video after I’m done with that in one of these blogs. This week has gone by surprisingly fast and I feel like I could have done more but we’ll keep that spirit for the following weeks.
