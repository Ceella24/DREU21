title: Week 7
---

I mentioned last week how I had a slow week and had to deal with that, little did I know it was not going to be just one week. I am not sure whether it is because Monday was a holiday or because I was still not feeling my best or because my mentor was unusually busy but this week was probably the most unproductive for me. I was able to figure out the errors I was getting from my code, which it turns out was working all along but I was running the scripts in the wrong order: there was a script that run the other scripts in series but I wanted to check if one of the scripts I changed was working so I run it before the others but it would not work because it needed some files generated from the other scripts. I also resumed work on the Open-Source project but my mentor is taking over now so I would make unit test for those. I would get to work on those next week along one other assignment. I am glad I know what I am working on ahead of time so I can get to it even if my mentor is busy. I am still feeling a little unwell but I am hoping the last three weeks are very productive.
