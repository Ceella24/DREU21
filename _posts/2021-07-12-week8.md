title: Week 8

I had my 10 am subgroup meeting and did some work on the PPL open source project: I started work on mapping the strategy following the pseudocode to implementation. Later in the week, my mentor took over the mapping so I could work on creating a system test for the code. Still, I was lucky to have a discussion with my mentor and other members of the team on the article that discusses the Dynamic Regions PRM strategy. I then cloned the branch from the labâ€™s gitlab server and moved the files I need for the test. 
At the Friday meeting, we discussed having a practice presentation for the REU showcase on the 26th so I have to get started on putting together slides for my presentation.
