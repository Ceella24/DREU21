My last week as a DREU intern has come faster than expected, well I’m still going to work on my project so it’s not really the end yet lol. I continued working on the protein binding site project, cleaning and testing the code with my mentor and teammates. Also, my mentor, myself and one other teammate started a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 15-minute 8 am scrum meeting to get ourselves set up for the day. Mondays and Fridays were left out since we have the bio subgroup meeting on Monday and the full group meeting on Friday. 
I also worked on the final DREU milestone requirements and finishing up my blogs although I might continue journaling the rest of the project for as long as I work on it. I am going to be a little busy next week but I am looking forward to some rest after that and then give my all to finish up this project.
