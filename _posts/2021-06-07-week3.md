title: Week 3

With a slow second week, I came into the third week with the aim to complete the goal I set for myself for the third week. I finally completed my first and second DREU milestones. For module 1, I was still left with the discussion of the Probabilistic Roadmap article so I could finish off my discussion questions. For the remainder of the second module, I made changes to my code to make a comparison, unlike last week, the comparison this time was between different k values (which based on my understanding of that line of code just describes how many nodes are connected to a new generated node). The k values were set at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32.

The above is an example of the roadmap generated by code, the difference is that the edges (the green lines connecting the green boxes/nodes) are increase or decrease for a different k value. So, what I observed was that the edges increased with increasing k value. I tried to generate a path and it showed me the path, the yellow line shown in the shot below.

If you have been following my blogs you would have realized that the picture above is a little different from the ones from last week. That is because I set the code to run a query so as to build a roadmap and path but the ones before were set to generate only nodes. 
A generated roadmap of the previous examples is:

Now, I am trying to get to the third module but I decided to post the blogs for my website; I’m running into issues but hopefully by next week I would have them figured out them complete the first section of module 3 (I don’t need to do the rest of the sections) and hopefully get into my project for the summer. Lookout for blogs on me working on protein-ligand binding problems.
