## About My Mentor

My mentors Dr. Nancy M. Amato and Dr. Marco M. Aguirre are both faculty members of the Computer Science Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

Dr. Amato is the Head of the Department of Computer Science and Abel Bliss Professor. She had her Ph.D degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois and taught at Texas A&M University and is now back to teaching there. She has been working with the Parasol Lab as co-director. Her research interests are in motion plaaning, robotics, computational biology, computational geometry, animation, CAD, VR, parallel and distributed computing, parallel algorithms, performance modelling and optimization. My mentor is a very dedicated person but is also very fun to be with. For more amazing information about her, just google her. 

Dr. Aguille is the Teaching Associate Professor of the Computer Science Department. His research interests are focused on algorithms for motion planning and control with applications to autonomous robots, machine learning, computational geometry, bioinformatics and computational neuroscience. He is also an amazing professor, researcher and mentor who has a lot to offer in terms of knowledge and fun. You would want to google him too.
